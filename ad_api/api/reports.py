        Requests a Sponsored Products report.

        Request the creation of a performance report for all entities of a single type which have performance data to report. Record types can be one of campaigns, adGroups, keywords, productAds, asins, and targets. Note that for asin reports, the report currently can not include metrics associated with both keywords and targets. If the targetingId value is set in the request, the report filters on targets and does not return sales associated with keywords. If the targetingId value is not set in the request, the report filters on keywords and does not return sales associated with targets. Therefore, the default behavior filters the report on keywords. Also note that if both keywordId and targetingId values are passed, the report filters on targets only and does not return keywords.
